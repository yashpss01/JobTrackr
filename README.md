## 🚀 Job Application Tracker 

The **Job Application Tracker** is a simple web application designed to help users manage and organize their job search.  
It provides a structured way to record job applications, track their statuses across different stages of the hiring process, and keep all relevant details in one place.

This project was built to strengthen frontend development skills, especially in DOM manipulation, state management using JavaScript, and data persistence via local storage — all without relying on any backend.
